# HTH-Hackathon-107
A EdTech project from TEAM SILENT ASSASSINS

 ★
 Traditional learning is often passive and theoretical, making subjects feel
 disconnected from real-world applications.
 ★
 Standardized teaching methods fail to adapt to individual student needs—fast
 learners get bored, while struggling students fall behind. 
★
 The lack of interactive
 and personalized learning experiences results in low engagement and retention.
 ★
 To bridge this gap, we are going to build a dynamic, AI-powered gamified
 solution that makes learning adaptive, immersive, and accessible for everyone.
